# INVENTION-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-DBMS
The main aim of this project is to develop a database system for the inventor 
application to maintain all the data conveniently and efficiently. This provides faster 
data access, helps users to read data in database, can share depending on the 
authorisation to access the data. There will be no chance of encountering duplicate 
data. The project mainly focuses on developing a database management system to 
store and maintain the database consisting, the details of various inventions and the 
information about them like inventor, category, year, story behind the invention, 
awards received and the year, inventor name, country, job type and a database 
consisting of different awards in each category. Awards are given by nominations to 
inventors for which the jury’s decision is final. For this we are maintaining the jury’s 
list too. The information is inputted to their corresponding entities and various 
relationships are made within them. The information of the entities like inventor, 
invention, award, nominations, jury are entered accordingly. Based on this the award 
decision is made by jury.
